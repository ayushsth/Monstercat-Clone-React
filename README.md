# Tech Stack

2) Embla Carousel
3) CSS


## About this Project

For this project, Embla Carousel was used. Embla Carousel is a lightweight carousel library with fluid motion and great swipe precision. It is a 100% open source and dependency free library.

## Features

- Autoplay Plugin was used for Autoplay of slides
- Previous & Next Button
- Navigation Bar
- Pagination dots with Active State

## Few Design Compromises

- The font used in the reference was licencesed and paid. So a very similar font, i.e. 'Monument Extended' was used as font.
- Different logos were used as that of the reference. The icons used weren't freely available so visually similar icons were used.
- The logo of Monstercat Logo was very dificult to find, so that logo wasn't added.
- Progress bar animation was not achieved.
